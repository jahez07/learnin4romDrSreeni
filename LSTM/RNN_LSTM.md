# **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) & Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**

## Traditional Deep Learning
1. Image Analysis
We will have an input image which is passed through a **Convolutional** which extracts features from the input and then pass it to **Max Pool** Layers which is then passed to **Fully Connected** Dense layers from which we get the output. And the output would be a probability of class.

The difference between the *Traditional Deep Learning Model* and *Recurrent Network* is that traditional DL is a feed forward network and in RNN the information is also back propagated, in simpler terms RNN remembers the past.
